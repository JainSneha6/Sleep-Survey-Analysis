# Sleep Survey Analysis using R

Welcome to the Sleep Survey Analysis project! This project aims to analyze sleep schedules based on various parameters using R.

## About the Project

This project utilizes R programming language to analyze sleep patterns and schedules based on data collected from surveys. The analysis includes exploring correlations between different factors such as gender, age, daily routines, and sleep quality to understand their impact on sleep duration and quality.
